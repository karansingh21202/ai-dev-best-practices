# 🔐 AI-Coded App Security Checklist
> Prevent critical vulnerabilities in AI-generated / vibe-coded applications

> Rule of thumb: **Never trust the client. Never trust the AI blindly.**

---

## 1️⃣ Never Talk to the Database Directly from the Client

❌ Frontend → Database (Supabase / Firebase direct access)

✅ Correct Pattern:
Frontend → **Backend API (Middleware)** → Database

**Why?**
Direct DB access is like leaving your front door open. Anyone can bypass UI rules.

**Action**
- Always create a backend layer (API / serverless function)
- Move all DB logic to the server

---

## 2️⃣ Gatekeep Every Single Action (Authorization Everywhere)

❌ User is logged in → allow everything

✅ Correct Pattern:
- Every endpoint must verify:
  - Who the user is
  - What they are allowed to do

**Action**
- Check permissions on **every API request**
- Never assume login = authorization

> Treat each endpoint like a high-security door

---

## 3️⃣ Never Hide Premium Features on the Client

❌ Ask backend: `isPremium = false` → hide button in UI

✅ Correct Pattern:
- Backend only sends premium data **if user is premium**

**Why?**
Users can modify frontend responses easily.

**Action**
- Do permission checks on the server
- Deliver premium content conditionally from backend

---

## 4️⃣ Keep Secrets Off the Browser

❌ API keys in frontend code
❌ Stripe / OpenAI keys in client JS

✅ Correct Pattern:
- Secrets live **only on the server**

**Rule**
> If it runs in the browser, it’s public.

---

## 5️⃣ `.env` Files ≠ Security

❌ Assuming `.env` makes secrets safe

**Reality**
- `.env` only prevents Git commits
- Keys can still be bundled into client code

**Action**
- Double-check what gets shipped to the browser
- Use server-only environment variables

---

## 6️⃣ Never Do Sensitive Math on the Client

❌ Price calculations
❌ Score logic
❌ Credit / quota math on frontend

✅ Correct Pattern:
- Perform all calculations on the backend

**Why?**
Users can manipulate client-side logic.

---

## 7️⃣ Sanitize All Inputs (No Exceptions)

❌ Trusting user input
❌ Directly inserting text into DB

✅ Correct Pattern:
- Sanitize all inputs
- Treat user input as plain text, never commands

**Protects Against**
- SQL injection
- NoSQL injection
- XSS
- Broken queries

---

## 8️⃣ Rate Limit Everything

❌ Unlimited button clicks
❌ Unlimited API calls

✅ Correct Pattern:
- Rate limit per user / IP / token

**Why?**
- Prevent abuse
- Prevent cost explosions
- Prevent DoS-style attacks

---

## 9️⃣ Never Log Sensitive Data

❌ Logging passwords
❌ Logging tokens
❌ Logging emails

**Action**
- Remove debug logs before production
- Mask sensitive fields

> Logs are often more dangerous than databases.

---

## 🔟 Audit with a Rival AI

**Best Practice**
- If you coded with one AI, audit with another

**Example**
- Build with Claude → audit with Gemini
- Build with GPT → audit with Claude

**Why?**
Different models catch different failure modes.

---

## ✅ Final Rule

> **AI can write code fast. Humans must enforce boundaries.**

Security is not optional — especially in AI-generated apps.
