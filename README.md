# AI Coding Best Practices

A curated set of best practices, rules, and patterns to help developers and AI coding assistants write **secure, maintainable, and production-ready code**.

This repository focuses on **how AI should be guided while coding**, not just how code should look.

---

## Why this repository exists

Modern AI tools can generate large amounts of code quickly, but:
- They often skip security boundaries
- They assume incorrect project setups
- They mix frontend and backend responsibilities
- They make unsafe defaults unless explicitly guided

These best practices exist to:
- Reduce vulnerabilities in AI-generated code
- Standardize how AI tools should behave
- Make projects safer, cleaner, and more predictable

---

## What this repository covers

- Security best practices for AI-coded applications
- Frontend rules (Tailwind, React, framework assumptions)
- Backend rules (APIs, authorization, data access)
- LLM-friendly documentation patterns
- Rules that can be enforced via AI tools like Cursor
